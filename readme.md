## Introduction

Valet is a Laravel development environment for Mac minimalists. No Vagrant, no `/etc/hosts` file. You can even share your sites publicly using local tunnels. _Yeah, we like it too._

Laravel Valet configures your Mac to always run Nginx in the background when your machine starts. Then, using [DnsMasq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq), Valet proxies all requests on the `*.dev` domain to point to sites installed on your local machine.

In other words, a blazing fast development environment. Valet provides a great alternative if you want flexible basics or prefer extreme speed.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Valet can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/valet).
